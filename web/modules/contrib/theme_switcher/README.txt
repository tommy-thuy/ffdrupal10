INTRODUCTION
------------

The Theme Switcher module allows you to create theme-switching rules which 
allow automatic selection of a theme based on Drupal 8 Conditions system. 
Because of this it can also be easily extended to support additional 
custom conditions exposed by other modules. In Drupal 8 conditions are no 
longer defined through a hook and they are plugins now.

This modules is currently only available for Drupal 8.

* Configuring theme switcher rules:

    - To create a theme switcher rule, you must provide the following 
    information:

        * A *name* to be used in lists of theme switcher rules.
        * A *machine_name* that must be unique. This value will be 
        autogenerated and cannot be edited once created.
        * A *status* indicating `active` or `inactive`.
        * A hidden field *weight* that can be changed using the list drag&drop 
        interface.
        * A *theme* to apply when each conditions are evaluated and pass.
        * A set of *Conditions* that indicate each one of the variables that 
        must be satisfied by the rule to apply the above selected theme.

    **IMPORTANT**: All the rules will be evaluated in the order of the list. 
    This means that once the rule pass all its conditions in a satisfying way 
    the rest of the rules will not be evaluated.

 Q: What can I do with this module?

 A: You can apply a specific theme to a unique node, use different themes based
    on the page language, use contrib conditions like a domain to apply one
    theme or another. The best of all is that you can do al of the above at
    once!
